There are many writing apps for you to choose from today, so why bother with yet another one? Because Simpletext is simpler. It’s single-minded commitment to simplicity means you’ll get a no-frills writing app that works well and looks great, forever
Simpletext started as a digital project because I couldn’t find what I was looking for. Most apps were trying to do too much and ended up bloated with features I don’t need. So I built Simpletext based on a simple premise — what if there’s an app that refuses to do more, choosing instead to do just one thing, and do it well? For Simpletext, that one thing is writing.
